# Fillit

Filit is the second project in the basic C path in 42 School Silicon Valley Galaxy. In this activity the user inputs a file which contains diferent tetraminos, each one of them in a specific format which needs to be validated and then converted into a structure which can be understanded by our solving algorithm. Then you need to find the smallest square in which you can fit all the pieces correctly. After that you print the result in the standard output.
